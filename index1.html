            <h2>PAMEX ransomware attack</h2>
            <p>Hackers have demanded a payment of almost US $5 million in bitcoin from Pemex after a cyberattack on the state oil company’s systems on Sunday.
              According to the news agency Reuters, a ransom note that appeared on Pemex computers pointed to a dark net website affiliated with DoppelPaymer, a type of ransomware.
              It demanded Pemex pay 565 bitcoins, or just over US $4.9 million, within 48 hours in order to have the ransomware removed.
              The ransom note said: “Your network has been penetrated. This link and your decryption key will expire in 14 days after your systems were infected . . . We have gathered all your private sensitive data. So if you decide not to pay, we would share it. It may harm your business reputation.”</p>
